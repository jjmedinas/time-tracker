#### Edge Cases
- Users canâ€™t checkout without checking in first
- what to do when an user forgets checking out? (Show a notification? - Business logic decision)

#### Common Errors
 - 403 - You're not allowed to perform this action.
 - 401 - Email and password don't match.
 - 400 - Email and password don't match.
 - 400 - Check in time already set. Can't to check in again.
 - 400 - Unable to check out. Please verify check in had place and hasn't already checked out.

#### Recommendations
Some actions can be taken in order to improve the app:

- Create a setup document with steps to run project. It can be added to this readme.
- Implement a template engine (slim, haml) or event better add a frontend framework (react, vue, etc)
- Add integration tests with Capybara (It can be used to test login flow)
- Add serialization (This is a cool [gem](https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi) to do so)
- Improve foreman + webpacker setup
